# UI & Frontend Rules for My Library

- This project is a book library built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Vite.
- The Browse Library page allows users to search, filter, and download books.
- The search bar must be dynamic and case-insensitive, fetching data from Supabase.
- When clicking on a book, it should navigate to the Book Details page.
- All UI elements should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile.
- Favorite, Like ❤️, and Save buttons must be interactive and update the database.
- The User Dashboard should show interactive statistics like total books, downloads, and currently reading.
- Ensure that clicking on any book in My Library leads to its Book Details page.
